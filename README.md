# agent-dotfiles

Custom configurations for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex). This repository contains slash commands, skills, templates, and other customizations that extend agent capabilities.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Config Location | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/` | Full support |
| Codex | `~/.codex/` | Partial (no sub-agents) |

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-dotfiles.git
cd agent-dotfiles

# Install for Claude Code
./install.sh claude

# Install for Codex
./install.sh codex

# Non-interactive mode (for automation)
./install.sh claude -n
```

The install script creates symlinks from this repository to the agent's config directory. This allows you to version control your customizations and easily sync them across machines.

## Uninstallation

```bash
./uninstall.sh claude
./uninstall.sh codex
```

Only symlinks pointing to this repository are removed. Existing directories are left unchanged.

## Optional: cmux skills

[cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) ships agent skills that let coding agents drive its UI — the built-in agent browser, windows, workspaces, panes/surfaces, settings, and more. These are **opt-in** and not installed by `install.sh`.

`scripts/cmux-skills.sh` fetches a pinned ref of cmux's skills from GitHub (reusing cmux's own installer) and drops them into `skills/`. Since both Claude Code and Codex symlink `skills/`, installing once makes them available to both agents. The fetched `cmux*` directories are gitignored, so they never get committed into your dotfiles.

```bash
./scripts/cmux-skills.sh list                 # list available cmux skills
./scripts/cmux-skills.sh install              # install all cmux skills
./scripts/cmux-skills.sh install --skill cmux --skill cmux-browser
./scripts/cmux-skills.sh install --dry-run    # preview without installing
./scripts/cmux-skills.sh uninstall            # remove all cmux skills

# Pin a specific cmux version (default: main)
CMUX_SKILLS_REF=v1.2.3 ./scripts/cmux-skills.sh install
```

Restart the agent (or start a new session) after installing. Once installed, ask the agent to use them: "use the cmux-browser skill to open this URL in a new window".

## Directory Structure

| Directory | Description | Claude Code | Codex |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `commands/` | Custom slash commands | `~/.claude/commands/` | `~/.codex/prompts/` |
| `agents/` | Sub-agent definitions | `~/.claude/agents/` | Not supported |
| `skills/` | Skill definitions | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| `templates/` | Reusable templates | `~/.claude/templates/` | `~/.codex/templates/` |
| `scripts/` | Helper scripts | `~/.claude/scripts/` | `~/.codex/scripts/` |

## Usage

After installation, custom commands are available in your agent session:

```
# In Claude Code
/mr_create_spec    # Create a specification document
/mr_plan           # Create an implementation plan
/mr_implement_plan # Implement the plan

# In Codex (commands are called "prompts")
/prompts:mr_create_spec
```

To invoke a skill, ask the agent to use it: "use circleci skill to check build status".

## Available Workflows

### 1. Research + Plan + Implement Workflow

A structured workflow for tackling complex tasks in large codebases, inspired by [HumanLayer](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer). See [full documentation](docs/HumanLayerWorkflow.md).

**Main workflow:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hl_research_codebase` | Research the codebase using parallel sub-agents |
| `/hl_create_plan` | Create detailed implementation plans |
| `/hl_implement_plan` | Execute plans with verification |

**Handoff:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hl_create_handoff` | Create handoff document for session transfer |
| `/hl_resume_handoff` | Resume work from a handoff document |

**Other commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hl_report_plan_progress` | Save progress to the plan document |
| `/hl_validate_plan` | Validate implementation against the plan |

### 2. Spec-Driven Workflow

A variation that starts with a specification phase to clarify requirements before research. See [full documentation](docs/SpecDrivenWorkflow.md).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mr_create_spec` | Interview user to identify requirements and edge cases; produce `spec.md` |
| `/mr_research_codebase` | Research codebase relevant to the spec; produce `research.md` |
| `/mr_plan` | Create `plan.md` and `plan_phase_N.md` from spec + research |
| `/mr_implement_plan` | Implement using TDD with plan as source of truth |
| `/mr_validate_implementation` | Validate implementation against spec/plan; run tests and coverage |

**Flow variations** (depending on task complexity):
- **Full**: Spec → Research → Plan → Implement
- **Short**: Spec → Plan Mode (Shift+Tab in Claude Code) → Implement
- **Straight**: Spec → Implement (for simple, well-defined features)

### 3. Executable Plan Workflow

A simplified two-step workflow combining research and planning into one phase. Inspired by [OpenAI Codex Execution Plans](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/codex_exec_plans) and Aaron Friel's talk [Shipping with Codex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr41tYOzE20&t=770s). See [full documentation](docs/ExecutablePlanWorkflow.md).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ep_create_exec_plan` | Analyze spec, research codebase, and create executable plan |
| `/ep_implement_exec_plan` | Implement autonomously, maintaining the plan as a living document |

**Key features:**
- Self-contained plans that any novice agent can follow
- Living document with progress, decisions, and discoveries
- Autonomous implementation without constant user prompts
- Session resumption from the plan document

**Recommended flow**: Create spec first with `/mr_create_spec`, then use this workflow.

Designed for **Codex** (400K context, autonomous hours-long work, meticulous research). Works with Claude Code, but re-read the plan if auto-compact kicks in.

## Helper Commands

Utility commands that work across all workflows.

**Git:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mr_commit` | Create git commits with user approval (no Claude attribution) |

**Handoff:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mr_handoff` | Create handoff document for session transfer |
| `/mr_resume_handoff` | Resume work from a handoff document |

**Pull Requests:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mr_describe_pr` | Generate PR descriptions from repository templates |
